# Wolfie
Its basically a data sharing app, where dat can be bounded to the area defined by the user. Or we can see it another way, lets suppose
we want to automate the data accessibilty. For example: A live data will be shared when the user is in the given area, lets suppose there
is an event and you want that particular data should stream to all people present at the event.
  It was originally started as the course project in a group of three.
